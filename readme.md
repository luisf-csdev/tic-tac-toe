  <h1> Tic-Tac-Toe </h1>
  <p>A tic-tac-toe study project with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
</div>

## Overview
This project is a simple study web application designed to implement the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a line of three consecutive markers (X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the game board.
- **CSS**: Styles the elements and enhances the visual experience.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including handling player turns, checking for win conditions, and managing the game state.

## How to Play
1. Two players take turns clicking on the empty squares of the grid to place their respective markers (X or O).
2. The first player to align three of their markers consecutively in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
3. If all spaces on the board are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
